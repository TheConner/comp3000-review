%% * I/O redirection
%%   - how to do it

The I/O redirection we implemented is \textit{ms-dos} style. Because dos could
only run one process at a time, the general workflow was something like this

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run process A and put the output to some TMP file \texttt{A > tmpfile}
\item Run process B with the input redirected from the tmpfile \texttt{B < tmpfile}
\end{enumerate}

In a more modern multiprocess system this would not involve writing anything to
the disk -- however here is how we implemented this in 3000shell:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run process A and put the output to some TMP file \texttt{A > tmpfile}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Run process A:} fork the current process, wait for the child to
    finish.
  \item \textbf{Put the output to some TMP file:} \texttt{open} the tmpfile, get
    the file descriptor. Create a copy of the old file descriptor, redirect stdout
    to the output file.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Run process B with the input redirected from the tmpfile \texttt{B}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Run process B:} fork the current process, wait for the child to
    finish.
  \item \textbf{Put the output to some TMP file:} \texttt{open} the tmpfile, get
    the file descriptor. Create a copy of the old file descriptor, redirect stdout
    to the output file.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
