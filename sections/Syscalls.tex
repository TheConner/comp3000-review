%% * system calls versus library calls (open, opendir, etc)
%%   - how the names aren't always the same

System calls are one layer above the kernel -- all a system call does is asks
the kernel to do something. They are very low level. Library calls consist of
system calls, so library calls can be thought of as an \textit{abstraction} of
system calls
