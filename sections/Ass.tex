\section{Assembly RBP, RSP}
%% Difference between base pointer (%rbp) and the stack pointer (%rsp) registers.
%%  * stack pointer is used to maintain the stack, is automatically changed by
%%    instructions like call and ret
%%  * base pointer register is good for doing relative addressing
%%    - so good for accessing local variables and parameters

\texttt{RBP} is the base pointer, and \texttt{RSP} is the stack pointer.

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{RSP} memory address at the top of the stack 
\item \texttt{RBP} memory address of any stack frame, moves around the stack.
\end{itemize}
