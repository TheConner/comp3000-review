%% * UNIX pipes basics

The unix pipeline redirects the standard output of one program to the standard
input of another program.

\textbf{NOTE} in assignment 1 we implemented a MS-DOS style pipe command which
is different from what happens in UNIX. MS-DOS, because it could only run one
program at a time, would do the following
\begin{itemize}
\item Run program A, redirecting stdout to a temporary file \texttt{A >
    tmp.txt}
\item Run program B, redirecting stdin from a temporary file \texttt{B <
    tmp.txt}
\item This would happen seamlessly when the user types \texttt{A | B}
\end{itemize}
