# COMP3000 Review

Exam review for COMP3000 F19. 
This is built in LaTeX and should require a pretty complete TEX distro to compile. On linux, TeXLive is the way to go. On Windows use MIKTex since it dynamically downloads packages so you don't end up taking up a ton of disk space with packages you don't need.

# Building
Should build with a complete latex distro, you should be building to PDF *not* to DVI. If you're having issues building shoot me a message.

If you're not familiar with latex, consider the following editors / IDE's:

	- Vim-latex if you are a vim user
	- TeXStudio / TeXMaker if you value your sanity
	- Emacs + auctex for those who use emacs
	- I hear there's addons for VS code if you enjoy the "open source" (but not really open source) editor.

# Contributing
If you find errors - which is likely since my knowledge of 3000 pretty good but far from perfect - shoot me a message, or if you'd like you can make an account on this GitLab instance and make the changes yourself.

If you're not familiar with Git or LaTeX, I'll happily make the changes for you.
